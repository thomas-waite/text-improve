# text-improve

An NLP tool that will auto-generate cover letters and personal statements from a few bullet points of text supplied by the user.

The aim is to dramatically speed up the process of drafting these documents. It is not imagined that the result will be perfect, but rather a draft and skeleton that the user can then refine and adapt further.
